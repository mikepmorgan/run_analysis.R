# Getting and Cleaning Data Project


The repo ```run_analysis.R``` contains the code needed to run the file. The code is predicated on a user having downloaded the UCI HAR Dataset into their working directory, and having unzipped the files. 

The ```Code Book``` describes the code used to run the file, so a user can understand the output. 

The ```Tidy Data``` set contains the text file of the output.
