# Getting and Cleaning Data Project


The repo ```run_analysis.R``` contains the code needed to run the file. The code is predicated on a user having downloaded the UCI HAR Dataset into their working directory, and having unzipped the files. 

The ```Code Book``` describes the code used to run the file, so a user can understand the output. It also shows the colnames output from R so a user can understand the measures being evaluated (e.g mean, st, etc). 

There are also notes within the R file for what the code is doing, as it is doing it. 

Finally, the ```tidy``` data has been pushed to GitHub as its own file.
